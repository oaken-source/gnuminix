GNU/MINIX 
  - project codename 'DAWN' 

 This poject aims at creating an environment on which a load of bash scripts
 derived from the Linux From Scratch project[1] are capable of bootstrapping
 a running GNU/Minix Operating System, powered by Vagrant[2].

 Minix[3] is a Microkernel, which we hope will work well with the GNU userland
 to provide the open source community with an excellent alternative to Linux.

 The current build of GNU/Minix uses LFS version 7.4, and Minix version 3.2.1

Setup Guide:

 To prepare your system for using this environment, run the provided script:
  $> ./prepare-host.sh
 and follow the instructions given.

 To assemble the environment, run
  $> vagrant up

 And to access the (headless) machine, run
  $> vagrant ssh

Configuration:
 
 Every script in this project listens for an environment variable DEBUG. If 
 such a variable is defined to a String of non-zero length, then all scripts
 will be executed with 'set -x' defined in their headers.
 This allows for detailed information on what is executed when and makes 
 wathing the bootstrap process a little less dull :)

Required Packages:

 vagrant, virtualbox, bash

How It Works:

 Step1:
  Bootstrap a blank Ubuntu 12.04 LTS virtual machine using Vagrant
 Step2:
  Run a load of scripts in the vm that compile and bootstrap GNU/Minix on an
  external virtual disk
 Step3:
  Hang this disk into a physically identical virtual machine and hope it works
 Step4:
  Profit!

 Based on this, there are plans to go further and create a proper distribution
 including a package manager, etc. However, most of this is postponed until 
 there is a decently running GNU/Minix Bootstrap Build.

Current Status:

 Creating Infrastructure. Watch the NEWS file for a log of status updates
