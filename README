GNU/MINIX 
  - project codename 'DAWN'

 This poject aims at creating an environment on which a load of bash scripts
 derived from the Linux From Scratch project[1] are capable of bootstrapping
 a running GNU/Minix Operating System, powered by Vagrant[2].

 Minix[3] is a Microkernel, which we hope will work well with the GNU userland
 to provide the open source community with an excellent alternative to Linux.

 The current build of GNU/Minix uses LFS version 7.4, and Minix version 3.2.1

Setup Guide:

 To prepare your system for using this environment, run the provided script:
  $> ./prepare-host.sh
 and follow the instructions given.

 To assemble the environment, run
  $> vagrant up

 And to access the (headless) machine, run
  $> vagrant ssh

Required Packages:

 vagrant, virtualbox, bash
